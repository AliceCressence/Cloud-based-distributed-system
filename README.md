##  Abstract

This project proposes the redesign of the university’s Learning Management System (LMS) infrastructure into a **unified, cloud-native distributed system**.  
Currently, multiple isolated Moodle instances (Academics, Finance, HR) cause **data silos**, operational inefficiencies, and manual data transfers.  

### Key Objectives
- Integrate all Moodle instances through a **central event-driven communication backbone**.  
- Refactor monolithic Moodle functions into **independent microservices** (Enrollment, Billing, Grades).  
- Deploy on **AWS, GCP, or Azure**, orchestrated by **Kubernetes**.  
- Use **RabbitMQ** for asynchronous inter-service communication following the **Saga pattern**.  
- Achieve measurable KPIs:  
  - 99.95% uptime  
  - <200ms API latency  
  - 80% reduction in manual data entry

## 1️ Introduction & Problem Statement

Universities face digital fragmentation due to isolated systems for Academics, Finance, and HR.  
Manual data exchange leads to inefficiencies, data loss, and poor user experience.

### Impact
- **Students:** Frustration due to delays and errors in course access or billing.  
- **Faculty:** No unified view of student status.  
- **Administrators:** Time wasted on redundant manual tasks.

### Strategic Implication
Data fragmentation blocks the university from leveraging real-time analytics for strategic decisions.

## 2️⃣ Project Scope

### In-Scope
- Integration of **three Moodle instances** (Academics, Finance, HR).  
- Development of an **event-driven central communication backbone**.  
- Deployment on **cloud-native infrastructure**.  
- **API refactoring** of Moodle monolith functions.

### Out-of-Scope
- Creation of new Moodle user-facing features.  
- Large-scale legacy data migration.  
- Complete Moodle replacement.

---

## 3️⃣ Proposed Solution

A **distributed microservices architecture** will provide scalability, fault tolerance, and organizational agility.

### Key Design Principles
- **Scalability:** Use Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler.  
- **Resilience:** Implement PostgreSQL multi-AZ setup & Circuit Breaker pattern.  
- **Agility:** Enable asynchronous communication using **RabbitMQ** events.

---

## 4️⃣ System Design & Architecture

### Microservices Model
- **Authentication Service** – JWT-based user management  
- **Course Management Service** – Courses & rosters  
- **Enrollment Service** – Student enrollment orchestration  
- **Billing Service** – Invoice generation & payment processing  
- **Grades Service** – Grade management  
- **Notification Service** – Email/SMS/Push alerts  

### Communication
- **Asynchronous:** via RabbitMQ (publish-subscribe)  
- **Synchronous (exception):** via REST + Service Mesh (Istio/Linkerd)

### Data Consistency
- Each service maintains its own PostgreSQL DB.  
- Cross-service consistency ensured with the **Saga Pattern**.
